TITLE="My Wonderful"
LYRICS="''A time when I was down and out
No lovin in my life
this angel came and brought about
a meaning of some right
Took my dark and lonely days
Into the light
With his loving ways

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

Gotta have him close
to me
Each and every night
To give me that security
Of dreaming in delight
Love has got a grip on me
Oh so tight
Hope he never lets go

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

Cause I don't ever want to be free
From this love and care that
most people will never see
And at night I pray
That I'll have my way
And enjoy love for eternity

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me

No one can ever do for me
The things he does cause

He's my wonderful
Everything a girl could want
to love
And all I need
Yes he's my wonderful
Must have been sent from
up above
Just for me''

Why, I must have been thirteen when this came out!

Even if my heart should tell me so,

Just because I want someone who's kind,
with a heart as good and pure as mine.
But maybe I am asking for too much,

I know you think you're smart,

TITLE="Ticking"
LYRICS="''An extremely quiet child'' they called you in your school report
''He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught''
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died.

At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
''Oh, he's unconcerned with competition, he never cares to win''
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son.

''Now you'll never get to Heaven'' Mama said.
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
''Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed''
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking.

They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said ''His brains just snapped'' then someone called the police
 You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh, you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground.

Promising to hurt no-one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh, your childhood cried out in your head, ''They mean to do you harm''.

''Don't ever ride on the devil's knee'' Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
''Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread''
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking.

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens'
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule.

Oh, they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
''Throw out your gun , walk out slow just keep your hands held high''
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh, you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law.

''You've slept too long in silence'' Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
''Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head''
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking.

The frail form is drifting
Beyond the orc's zone
Time to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

TITLE="Pig-Me And The Whore"
LYRICS="''Big bottled Fraulein, put your weight on me,'' said the
pig-me to the whore,
desperate for more in his assault upon the mountain.
Little man, his youth a fountain.
Overdrafted and still counting.
Vernacular, verbose; an attempt at getting close to
where he came from.
In the doorway of the stars, between Blandford Street
and Mars;
Proposition, deal. Flying button feel. Testicle testing.
Wallet ever-bulging. Dressed to the left, divulging
the wrinkles of his years.
Wedding-bell induced fears.
Shedding bell-end tears in the pocket of her resistance.
International assistance flowing generous and full
to his never-ready tool.
Pulls his eyes over her wool.
And he shudders as he comes.
And my rudder slowly turns me into the Marylebone
Road.

''Paper late!'' cried a voice in the crowd.
''Old man dies!'' The note he left was signed 'Old Father Thames'

selling england by the pound.

Citizens of Hope & Glory,
Time goes by - it's the 'time of your life'.
Easy now, sit you down.
Chewing through your Wimpey dreams,
they eat without a sound;
digesting england by the pound.

Young man says 'you are what you eat' - eat well.
Old man says 'you are what you wear' - wear well.
You know what you are, you don't give a damn;
bursting your belt that is your homemade sham.

The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
- join the dance ....
Follow on! Till the Grail sun sets in the mould.
Follow on! Till the gold is cold.
Dancing out with the moonlit knight,
Knights of the Green Shield stamp and shout.

There's a fat old lady outside the saloon;
laying out the credit she plays Fortune.
The deck is uneven right from the start;
all of their hands are playing apart.

The Captain leads his dance right on through the night
- join the dance ....
Follow on! A Round Table-talking down we go.
You're the show!
Off we go with: - You play the hobbyhorse,
I'll play the fool.
We'll tease the bull
ringing round & loud, loud & round.
Follow on! With a twist of the world we go.

TITLE="The 'Priest' They Called Him"
LYRICS="''Fight tuberculosis, folks.'' Christmas Eve, an old
junkie selling Christmas seals on North Park Street.
The ''Priest,'' they called him. ''Fight tuberculosis, folks.''

People hurried by, gray shadows on a distant wall. 
It was getting late and no money to score.
He turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife.
Cab stop just ahead under a streetlight.
Boy got out with a suitcase. Thin kid in prep school clothes,
familiar face, the Priest told himself, watching from the doorway. 

''Remindsme of something a long time ago.'' The boy, there, with his overcoat
unbuttoned, reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare.

The cab drove away and turned the corner. The boy went inside
a building. ''Hmm, yes, maybe'' - the suitcase was there in the doorway.
The boy nowhere in sight. Gone to get the keys, most likely,
have to move fast. He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner.
Made it. Glanced down at the case. It didn't look like the case the boy had,
or any boy would have. The Priest couldn't put his finger on what was so
old about the case. Old and dirty, poor quality leather, and heavy. 

Better see what's inside. He turned into Lincoln Park, found an
empty place and opened the case. Two severed human legs that belonged to
a young man with dark skin. Shiny black leg hairs glittered in the
dim streetlight. The legs had been forced into the case and he had to use 
his knee on the back of the case to shove them out. ''Legs, yet,'' 
he said, and walked quickly away with the case. 

Might bring a few dollars to score. The buyer sniffed suspiciously.
''Kind of a funny smell about it.'' ''It's just Mexican leather.'' 
''Well, some joker didn't cure it.'' 

The buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor.

''Not even right sure he killed it, whatever it is.
Three is the best I can do and it hurts. But since this is Christmas 
and you're the Priest...'' he slipped three bills under the table into the 
Priest's dirty hand. The Priest faded into the street shadows, seedy
and furtive. Three cents didn't buy a bag, nothing less than a nickel. 

Say, remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back unless 
I paid him the three cents I owe him. Yeah, isn't that a fruit for ya, 
blow your stack about three lousy cents. 

The doctor was not pleased to see him. 

''Now, what do you WANT? I TOLD you!'' 

The Priest laid three bills on the table. The doctor put the
money in his pocket and started to scream. 

''I've had TROUBLES! PEOPLE have been around!
I may lose my LICENSE!'' The Priest just sat there, eyes, old and heavy with
years of junk, on the doctor's face. 

''I can't write you a prescription.'' The doctor jerked open a drawer
and slid an ampule across the table. ''That's all I have in the OFFICE!''
The doctor stood up. ''Take it and GET OUT!'' he screamed, hysterical.
The Priest's expression did not change. 

The doctor added in quieter tones, ''After all, I'm a professional man,
and I shouldn't be bothered by people like you.'' 

''Is that all you have for me? One lousy quarter G? Couldn't you lend 
me a nickel...?'' ''Get out, get out, I'll call the police I tell you.''

''All right, doctor, I'm going.'' Of course it was cold and far to walk, 
rooming house, a shabby street, room on the top floor.

''These stairs,'' coughed the Priest there, pulling himself up along the 
bannister. He went into the bathroom, yellow wall panels,
toilet dripping, and got his works from under the washbasin.

Wrapped in brown paper, back to his room, get every drop in the dropper. 

He rolled up his sleeve. Then he heard a groan from next door,
room eighteen. The Mexican kid lived there, the Priest had passed him on 
the stairs and saw the kid was hooked, but he never spoke, because he
didn't want any juvenile connections, bad news in any language.

The Priest had had enough bad news in his life.

He heard the groan again, a groan he could feel, no mistaking that groan 
and what it meant. ''Maybe he had an accident or something. 

In any case, I can't enjoy my priestly medications with that sound coming
through the wall.'' Thin walls you understand. The Priest put down his 
dropper, cold hall, and knocked on the door of room eighteen.

''Quien es?'' ''It's the Preist, kid, I live next door.''
He could hear someone hobbling across the floor.

A bolt slid. The boy stood there in his underwear shorts, eyes black with 
pain. He started to fall. The Priest helped him over to the bed. 

''What's wrong, son?'' ''It's my legs, senor, cramps, and now I am without
medicine.'' The Priest could see the cramps, like knots of wood there
in the young legs, dark shiny black leg hairs. 

''A few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race,
it was then that the cramps started.'' And now he has the leg cramps back 
with compound junk interest. The old Priest stood there, feeling the boy
groan. He inclined his head as if in prayer, went back and got his dropper.
''It's just a quarter G, kid.'' ''I do not require much, senor.''

The boy was sleeping when the Priest left room eighteen. 
He went back to his room and sat down on the bed.

Then it hit him like heavy silent snow. All the gray junk yesterdays. 
He sat there received the immaculate fix. And since he was himself a priest,
there was no need to call one.

Couldn't have been no more than 1 or 2
And I remember there was a radio 
Coming from the room next door
And my mother laughed the way some ladies do
Well it's late in the evening 
And the music's seeping through

Next thing I remember, I am walking down the street 
I'm feeling all right, I'm with my boys, I'm with my troops, yeah
Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool
And I heard the sound of acapella grooves, yeah
Singin' late in the evening
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah

And I learned to play some mean guitar
I was underage in this funky bar 
And I stepped outside and smoked myself a J
And when I come back to the room everybody just seemed to move
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
It was late in the evening
And I blew that room away

First thing I remember when you came into my life
I said, ''I'm gonna get that girl no matter what I do''
Well I guess I've been in love before
Once or twice I've been on the floor
But I never loved no one the way that I love you

And the crowd began to cheer 
He flew away

And I like to have a good time,
But if it gets too pale after a while
Honey and I start looking to find
One good man.
Hmm, don't you know I've been searching,
Oh yes I have!
One good man,
Oh ain't much, honey ain't much,
It's only everything, whoa.

An' I don't want much outa life,
I never wanted a mansion in the South.
I just-a want to find someone sincere
Who'd treat me like he talks,
One good man.
Oh honey don't you know that I've been looking.
Oh, one good man
Ain't much, honey it ain't much,
Oh, it's only everything.
All right.

Some girls they want to collect their men,
They wear 'em like notches on a gun.
Oh honey, but I know better than that,
I know that a woman only needs one.
One good man, oh,
Oh baby don't you know I've been looking, hmm.
One good man,
It ain't much, no, no honey it ain't much,
Oh, it's only every little thing,
Just-a everything, everything

The phone rings, it's Vicki callin'
She wants me to come to the crib 
She says, conversation's better than being lonely 
So I try my best to ad-lib 
I told the joke about the woman 
Who asked her lover ''Why is your organ so small'' 
He replied ''I didn't know I was playin' in a cathedral'' 
Vicki didn't laugh at all

This is where she wants to be 
I am what she wants to see 
I never known a love so sweet 
Still I keep Vicki waiting
Alright 

All is well in Gotham City 
The sound of terror is all you hear 
Sometimes a pistol takes the place of her body 
Sometimes her body's here 
But you see when crime is your only love 
All that matter is the present, the here and now 
People, people, whatever floats this joker's boat 
Is whatever this joker will bang

Oh, yeah 

Talk of children still frightens me 
Is my character enough to be 
One that deserves a copy made
This I one day, hope to see 
Until then she's held at bay 
By my animal-like persistence 
Or maybe she's just too proud to say 
That fate (fate) brought us together 
And this is where she wants to stay

Spread out on the floor of her father's house
Her promise was almost undone
Under her tongue, dissolving her responsibilities
To finally deny everyone with unflattering comparison

CHORUS
All grown up
And you don't care anymore
And you hate all the people that you used to adore
And you despise all the rumors and lies of the life you led
before

Did I hear you right?
You're feeling hounded and pushed around
You want to just lay down and die
If all of this life has been such a big disappointment to you
Why don't you stop blaming some guy
And go give the next one a try

CHORUS

But look at yourself
You'll see you're still so young
You haven't earned the weariness
That sounds so jaded on your tongue

''I'm weak'' she says
And blesses herself and gets into bed
Clutching the covers to her throat
''So punish me now and let me go back to the sham of my life''
''This night is the perfect antidote for all of the poison that
you wrote''

Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around.

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer
Making for the sea.

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down.
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground.
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.

Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees.

In the lazy water meadow I lay me down.
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground.
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.

Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox
Gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,

And were taking him away.
''My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
And my time it isn't long,
And I still do not know
What it was that I've done wrong.''

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,
A tear came to his eye,
''You fail to understand,'' he said,
''Why must you even try?''
Outside, the crowd was stirring,
You could hear it from the door.
Inside, the judge was stepping down,
While the jury cried for more.

''Oh, stop that cursed jury,''
Cried the attendant and the nurse,
''The trial was bad enough,
But this is ten times worse.''
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape,
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape.

Congratulations, you have won
It's a year subscription of bad puns
And it makes your story of concern
And you set it up before it burns

My opinions, mmm (x4)

And it seems to be a problem here
And the steer of emotion seems to clear
Now they rise and fall like wall street stock
And they have an effect on our peace talk

Our opinions, mmm
My opinions, mmm (x3)

Congratulations, you have won

And you set it up before it burns

Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better make your face up in
Your favorite disguise.
With your button down lips and your
Roller blind eyes.
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart.
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past.
With your nerves in tatters
When the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter
Down the door.
You'd better run.

Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run,
Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, Run.
You better run all day
And run all night.
Keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside.
And if you're taking your girlfriend
Out tonight
You'd better park the car
Well out of sight.
Cause if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks,
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a cardboard box.
You better run.

Do you still say your prayers little darling
Do you go to bed at night
Praying that tomorrow, everything will be allright
But tomorrow's fall in number in number one by one
You wake up and you're dying you don't even know what from

Well they shot you point blank you been shot in the back
Baby point blank you been fooled this time, little girl that's a fact
Right between the eyes baby, point blank
Right between the pretty lies that they tell
Little girl you fell

You grew up where young girls they grow up fast
You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked
But what they asked baby wasn't right
You didn't have to live that live
I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet
These days you don't wait for Romeo's, you wait on that welfare check
And on all the pretty things that you can't ever have and on all the promises

That always end up point blank, shot between the eyes
Point blank like little white lies you tell to ease the pain
You're walking in the sights, girl of point blank
And it's one false move and baby the lights go out

Once I dreamed we were together again
Baby you and me
Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
We were standing at the bar it was hard to hear
The band was playing loud and you were shouting something in my ear
You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor
You just stood there and held me, then you started dancing slow
And as I pulled you tighter I swore I'd never let you go

Well I saw you last night down on the avenue
Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you
You were standing in the doorway out of the rain
You didn't answer when I called out your name
You just turned and then you looked away 
Like just another stranger waiting to get blown away

Point blank, right between the eyes
Point blank, right between the pretty lies you fell
Point blank, shot straight through the heart

Yea point blank, you've been twisted up till you've become just another part of it
Point blank, you're walking in the sights
Point blank, living one false move, just one false move away
Point blank, they caught you in their sights
Point blank, did you forget how to love, girl did you forget how to fight
Point blank, they must have shot you in the head
Cause point blank, bang bang baby you're dead

Strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream...

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone 
Alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.''

''No reason to get excited,'' the thief, he kindly spoke,
''There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.''

All along the watchtower, princes kept the view
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.

Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

Of immortality
The deepest mystery
From an ancient book. I took a clue
I scaled the frozen mountain tops
Of eastern lands unknown
Time and Man alone
Searching for the lost - Xanadu

Xanadu -

To stand within The Pleasure Dome
Decreed by Kubla Khan
To taste anew the fruits of life
The last immortal man
To find the sacred river Alph
To walk the caves of ice
Oh, I will dine on honey dew
And drink the milk of Paradise

A thousand years have come and gone
But time has passed me by
Stars stopped in the sky
Frozen in an everlasting view
Waiting for the world to end
Weary of the night
Praying for the light
Prison of the lost - Xanadu

Xanadu -

Held within The Pleasure Dome
Decreed by Kubla Khan
To taste my bitter triumph
As a mad immortal man
Nevermore shall I return
Escape these caves of ice
For I have dined on honey dew
And drunk the milk of Paradise

Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Lordy, how they could love
Swore to be true to each other
Yeah, true to the skies above
He was her man, wouldn't do her no wrong

And Frankie and Johnny went walkin'
And Johnny had on a new suit
Yeah, Frankie spent one-hundred dollar notes
Just to make her man look cute
He was her man, he wouldn't do her no wrong

Frankie went over to the barroom
Stopped for a bottle of beer
Said to the old bartender man
''Has my lover Johnny man been here?''
''He was my man, Lord, but he'd been doin' me wrong, so wrong.''

Yeah, Frankie looked over the transom door
And there to her great surprise
There sat her lover man Johnny
Makin' love to Nellie Bly
He was her man, but he was doin' her wrong

Well, Frankie lifted up her kimono dress
And she drew (ladaladalala) out a little .44
She shot once, twice, three times (three times) she shot him
And through that hardwood (door) floor
Yeah, she shot her man (yeah he was her man)
Well, but he been doin' her wrong yeah

He said,'' roll me over so careful ah
Roll me over so slow,
Oh roll me off to my left hand side,
Because your bullet hurt me so,
I was your man, but I been doin' you wrong.''

Play it Chris!

Well, they sent for Frankie's mother
Come down to Huddie's saloon
To see what's the matter with her boy
She come down, Frankie looked up at her
Here what she said:

She said, ''Oh Mrs. Johnson, oh forgive me please
Well I killed your lovin' son, Johnny
But I'm down on my bended knee
I shot your man, 'cause he was doin' me wrong ah'.

She said, ''I'll forgive you Frankie,
She said, I'll forgive you not, not
For killin' lovin' son Johnny,
He's the only support that I've got,
'Lord, you shot my man and he was doin' you wrong.''

Well, the last time I seen Frankie
She was a-sittin' in a dungeon cell
She would be there lonely, herself
With no one there to care
She shot her man, a-he'd been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well, bring out the rubber tired (hearse) so long
You gotta bring out your pony and trap
Yeah, they're gonna take Johnny, Johnny to the cemetery (graveyard)
And he ain't never coming back
Well, he was her man
Oh, but he been doin' her wrong, so wrong

Well, the story ain't got no moral, Lordy
But the story ain't got no end
Well, the story only goes to show

Every night I fall again

'Oh, don't talk of love,' the shadows purr
Murmuring me away from you
'Don't talk of worlds that never were
The end is all that's ever true
There's nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can ever do...'
Still every night I burn
Every night I scream your name
Every night I burn
Every night the dream's the same
Every night I burn
Waiting for my only friend
Every night I burn
Waiting for the world to end

'Just paint your face,' the shadows smile
Slipping me away from you
'Oh, it doesn't matter how you hide
Find you if we're wanting to
So slide back down and close your eyes
Sleep a while, you must be tired...'
But every night I burn
Every night I call your name
Every night I burn
Every night I fall again
Every night I burn
Scream the animal scream
Every night I burn
Dream the crow black dream
Every night I burn
Scream the animal scream
Every night I burn
Dream the crow black dream

Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream

LYRICS="'Everyone feels good in the room,' she swings
'Two chord cool in the head,' she sings
'A-buzz a-buzz a-buzzing like them killer bees...'
Tell me this is not for real
Please simply this is not for real...

From time to time her eyes get wide
And she's always got them stuck on me
I'm surprised at how hot honey-colored and hungry she looks
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
Yeah I feel that good

She slips from the stage
A foot no more
But it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
And the two chord cool still grooves
As she slides towards me smooth as a snake
I can't swallow I just start to shake
And I just know this is a big mistake
Yeah but it feels good!

Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!
Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!

'If you want I can take you on another kind of ride...'
'Believe me I would but...'
Deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
I am yearning for another taste
And my shaking is 'yes'

'You will be all the things in the world you've never been
See all the things in the world you've never seen
Dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed...'
But I think I get a bit confused
Am I seducing or being seduced?

Oh I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad
But I really couldn't care about that
She's grinning, singing, spinning me round and round
Smiling as I start to fall
Her face gets big, her face gets small
It's like tonight I'm really not me at all
And it feels good!

Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!
Do it to me! Do it to me! Do it to me!

It feels good!
